How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I could quickly scan through only the differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I will be able to go back and rectify mistakes and feel more free to experiment.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    More granular control over version, you don't really want to end up saving stuff you don't really want to save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git probably allows you to do that because when working on bigger projects, you need to work on more than one file at the same time. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Not sure yet man!

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Unlimited undos!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Not sure actuallyâ€¦ Probably to learn Python.
