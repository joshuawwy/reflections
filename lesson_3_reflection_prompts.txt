When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want others to also see what you have done?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

More control!

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks is a Github only feature, we use it when we want to take someone's code and work on it on our own. After forking a repository, we can clone it to our local repo. Branches are made on your own repository when you want to try out something without breaking your main master branch.
