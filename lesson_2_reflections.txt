What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git gets started, a .git folder gets created. You need to do it to tell Git to get started.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's different as it offers one the ability to clarify one's own thought process. It also allows me to decide what to commit together and what file to commit separately.
